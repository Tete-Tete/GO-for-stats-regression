# Go Regression Analysis Tool

This repository contains a Go implementation for regression analysis. It includes a main.go file, which serves as the entry point, and a regression_test.go file for testing the functionality of the regression features.
##  Overview
The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and effective tool for performing regression analysis. It aims to help users explore relationships between variables using linear regression techniques.

## Features
- **Linear Regression Analysis**: Implements linear regression to analyze data trends.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes regression_test.go to validate the implementation with various test cases.
- **Output graph**: Includes graph that created by this tool 

## Requirements
- Go programming language installed (version 1.16 or higher recommended).

## Installation From Git and Set up for your own computer
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone <https://github.com/Tete-Tete/GO-for-stats-regression.git>
```

### Step 2: Run the Application
To run the Go application, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
go build -o regression
```
This will create a file named `regression` in your current directory.

## Testing
This project includes test cases to validate the linear regression calculations.
### Running Tests
To run tests, use:
This command will execute all unit tests, including those in regression_test.go, which verify the correctness of the linear regression calculations.

## Roles of Programs and Data
- **Programs**: The primary program is contained in main.go, which is responsible for executing the regression analysis. The test file (regression_test.go) is used for unit testing to ensure that the regression functions work as intended. 
- **Data**: The data used for regression analysis can be input directly in the code, or you can modify main.go to read from a file or database if needed.

## Conclusion

The final program will display the execution time for each linear regression performed on the datasets in Anscombe's quartet, highlighting the efficiency of the implemented algorithm. Additionally, the program will generate graphs for each dataset, allowing users to visually compare the datasets and understand the differences that statistical analysis alone might not reveal. The graphical output is particularly useful for demonstrating the importance of visualizing data along with statistical analysis. Users may find it insightful to compare these results with implementations in other languages, such as Python or R, to evaluate performance and visual output differences.
